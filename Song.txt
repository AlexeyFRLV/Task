Alter Bridge - Watch over You

first couplete:
	Leaves are on the ground
	Fall has come
	Blue skies turning grey
	Like my love

	I tried to carry you
	And make you whole
	But it was never enough
	I must go

chorus:
	Who is gonna save you
	When I'm gone?
	And who'll watch over you
	When I'm gone?

second couplete:
	You say you care for me
	But hide it well
	How can you love someone
	And not youself?
	
chorus:
	Who is gonna save you
	When I'm gone?
	And who'll watch over you
	When I'm gone?
	
third couplete:
	And when I'm gone
	Who will break your fall?
	Who will you blame?
	I can't go on
	And let you lose it all
	It's more than I can take
	Who'll ease your pain?
	Ease your pain?

chorus:
	Who is gonna save you
	When I'm gone?
	Who'll watch over you?
	Who will give you strength
	When you're not strong?
	Who'll watch over you
	When I've gone away?

ending:
	Snow is on the ground
	Winters come
	You long to hear my voice
	But I'm long gone...
