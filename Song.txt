Alter Bridge - Watch over You

first couplete:
	Leaves are on the ground
	Fall has come
	Blue skies turning grey
	Like my love

	I tried to carry you
	And make you whole
	But it was never enough
	I must go

chorus:
	Who is gonna save you
	When I'm gone?
	And who'll watch over you
	When I'm gone?

second couplete:
	You say you care for me
	But hide it well
	How can you love someone
	And not youself?
	
chorus:
	Who is gonna save you
	When I'm gone?
	And who'll watch over you
	When I'm gone?
